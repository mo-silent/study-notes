## Overview

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances [language models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) by combining them with external knowledge bases. RAG addresses [a key limitation of models](https://www.glean.com/blog/how-to-build-an-ai-assistant-for-the-enterprise): models rely on fixed training datasets, which can lead to outdated or incomplete information.
